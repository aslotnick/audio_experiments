    "This result is pretty good. We've reduced the time to listen to this clip without altering the pitch.

It requires converting the audio into the frequency domain using the short-time Fourier transform ([STFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform)), combining the windows in a way that minimizes noise, then converting back to time domain with an inverse STFT. Implementing this is beyond my expertise at the moment, but luckily [Brian McFee](http://bmcfee.github.io/) has written a Python implementation in the excellent [librosa](https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa) library. \n",
